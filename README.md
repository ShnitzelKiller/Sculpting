# 2D Sculpting

To see the results of the python implementation, run
```
python canvas.py
```
There will be a series of plots, each showing steps in the construction of various shapes (CSG operations followed by signed distance field updates, then shrinking and fattening).

To run the Julia version, run
```
julia test.jl
```
